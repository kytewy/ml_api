    "We want to complete data analysis\n",

    "The aim of the project is to build a machine learning model to predict the sale price of homes based on different explanatory variables describing aspects of residential houses.\n",

    "### Why is this important? \n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting house prices is useful to identify fruitful investments or to determine whether the price advertised for a house is over or under-estimated.\n",
